### 2025-08-02 - Magnus - Collaboration System Implementation
**Status**: Completed
**Summary**: Implemented centralized collaboration system to prevent scattered file/folder creation by agents
**Key Findings**:
- Agents were potentially creating random directories and files for reports
- No centralized system existed for inter-agent communication
- Lack of visibility into what other agents had completed

**Actions Taken**:
- Created `.claude/collab/team_notes.md` as central collaboration hub
- Updated CLAUDE.md with Team Collaboration Protocol section
- Updated all 25 agent files with collaboration instructions
- Verified no agents had explicit random file creation instructions
- Established standardized format for team notes entries

**Next Steps/Recommendations**:
- All agents must now check team_notes.md before starting work
- All agents must append findings to team_notes.md when completing work
- Monitor compliance with new collaboration protocol
- Consider adding automated validation of team notes format
