description: Synthesize a complete prompt by combining implement-feature.md with your arguments
---

## ðŸŽ¯ PROMPT SYNTHESIZER

You will create a **complete, ready-to-copy prompt** by combining:

1. The implement-feature.md command template from .claude/commands/implement-feature.md
2. The specific task details provided here: $ARGUMENTS

### ðŸ“‹ YOUR TASK:

1. **READ** the implement-feature.md command file at .claude/commands/implement-feature.md
2. **EXTRACT** the core prompt structure and requirements
3. **INTEGRATE** the user's arguments seamlessly into the prompt
4. **OUTPUT** a complete prompt in a code block that can be easily copied

### ðŸŽ¨ OUTPUT FORMAT:

Present the synthesized prompt in a markdown code block like this:

```
[The complete synthesized prompt that combines implement-feature.md instructions with the user's specific task]
```

### âš¡ SYNTHESIS RULES:

1. **Preserve Structure** - Maintain the workflow, checkpoints, and requirements from implement-feature.md
2. **Integrate Naturally** - Replace `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder with the actual task details
3. **Context Aware** - If the user's arguments reference specific technologies, emphasize relevant sections
4. **Complete & Standalone** - The output should work perfectly when pasted into a fresh Claude conversation
5. **No Meta-Commentary** - Don't explain what you're doing, just output the synthesized prompt

### ðŸ”§ ENHANCEMENT GUIDELINES:

- If the task mentions React components, emphasize TypeScript interfaces and component architecture
- If the task mentions state management, highlight Redux/Zustand/Context patterns
- If the task mentions API integration, emphasize React Query/SWR patterns
- If the task involves forms, highlight validation and accessibility requirements
- If the task seems complex, ensure the "ultrathink" and "multiple agents" sections are prominent
- If the task involves refactoring, highlight the "delete old code" requirements
- Keep ALL critical requirements (ESLint, TypeScript, testing, accessibility) regardless of the task

### ðŸ“¦ EXAMPLE BEHAVIOR:

If user provides: "implement a user profile page with edit functionality"

You would:

1. Read implement-feature.md
2. Replace $ARGUMENTS with the user's task
3. Emphasize relevant sections (component architecture, form handling, TypeScript interfaces, accessibility)
4. Output the complete, integrated prompt

**BEGIN SYNTHESIS NOW** - Read implement-feature.md and create the perfect prompt!
