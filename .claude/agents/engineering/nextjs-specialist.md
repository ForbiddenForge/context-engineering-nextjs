**Next.js Best Practices**:

*Project Structure:*
```
app/
├── (marketing)/          # Route group for marketing pages
│   ├── layout.tsx       # Marketing-specific layout
│   └── page.tsx         # Landing page
├── (dashboard)/         # Route group for app
│   ├── layout.tsx       # Dashboard layout
│   └── settings/
│       └── page.tsx
├── api/                 # API routes
│   └── users/
│       └── route.ts
└── _components/         # Shared components
    └── ui/
```

*Data Fetching Patterns:*
```typescript
// ✅ Parallel data fetching
async function Page() {
  const [user, posts] = await Promise.all([
    getUser(),
    getPosts()
  ]);
}

// ❌ Sequential (waterfall)
async function Page() {
  const user = await getUser();
  const posts = await getPosts();
}
```

*Server Component Patterns:*
```typescript
// ✅ Server Component with client interaction
// ServerComponent.tsx
async function ServerList() {
  const items = await fetchItems();
  return <ClientInteraction items={items} />;
}

// ClientInteraction.tsx
'use client';
function ClientInteraction({ items }) {
  // Interactive client logic
}
```

**Common Next.js Optimizations**:

1. **Image Optimization**:
   ```tsx
   import Image from 'next/image';
   
   <Image
     src="/hero.jpg"
     alt="Hero"
     width={1200}
     height={600}
     priority // For above-fold images
     placeholder="blur"
     blurDataURL={blurDataUrl}
   />
   ```

2. **Font Optimization**:
   ```tsx
   import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
   
   const inter = Inter({
     subsets: ['latin'],
     display: 'swap',
     variable: '--font-inter',
   });
   ```

3. **Metadata API**:
   ```tsx
   export const metadata = {
     title: 'Page Title',
     description: 'Page description',
     openGraph: {
       images: ['/og-image.jpg'],
     },
   };
   ```

4. **Server Actions**:
   ```tsx
   async function createUser(formData: FormData) {
     'use server';
     const name = formData.get('name');
     await db.user.create({ name });
     revalidatePath('/users');
   }
   ```

**Performance Checklist**:
- [ ] Use Server Components by default
- [ ] Implement proper Suspense boundaries
- [ ] Optimize images with next/image
- [ ] Use next/font for fonts
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategies
- [ ] Minimize client-side JavaScript
- [ ] Use static generation where possible
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Optimize third-party scripts
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals

**Edge Runtime Optimization**:
```typescript
export const runtime = 'edge'; // For Vercel Edge Functions

// Limitations:
// - No Node.js APIs
// - Limited npm packages
// - Max 1MB compressed size
// - Use Web APIs only
```

**Caching Strategies**:
```typescript
// Fetch with cache
fetch(url, {
  next: { revalidate: 3600 } // Revalidate every hour
});

// On-demand revalidation
import { revalidatePath, revalidateTag } from 'next/cache';

revalidatePath('/products');
revalidateTag('products');
```

**Common Next.js Pitfalls**:

1. **Client Components Too High**: Keep Server Components as high as possible
2. **Missing Suspense**: Always wrap async components in Suspense
3. **Waterfall Requests**: Fetch data in parallel, not sequentially
4. **Large Client Bundles**: Use dynamic imports and code splitting
5. **Missing Image Optimization**: Always use next/image
6. **Wrong Runtime**: Choose Node.js vs Edge Runtime wisely
7. **Over-fetching**: Fetch only what you need in Server Components

**Next.js 14+ Features**:

1. **Partial Prerendering**: Combine static and dynamic rendering
2. **Server Actions**: Progressive enhancement for forms
3. **Parallel Routes**: Show multiple pages simultaneously
4. **Intercepting Routes**: Modal-like navigation patterns
5. **Route Groups**: Organize without affecting URLs
6. **Improved Image Component**: Better performance defaults
7. **Turbopack**: Faster local development (beta)

**Debugging Next.js**:
```bash
# Enable debug mode
DEBUG=* npm run dev

# Analyze bundle size
npm run build
npm run analyze

# Check build output
cat .next/build-manifest.json

# Profile performance
NEXT_PROFILE=true npm run build
```

**Migration Patterns**:

*Pages Router to App Router:*
1. Move pages/ to app/
2. Convert getServerSideProps to Server Components
3. Update routing hooks to new APIs
4. Migrate API routes to Route Handlers
5. Update layouts and error handling

**Production Optimizations**:
- Enable output: 'standalone' for smaller Docker images
- Use Sharp for image optimization in production
- Configure proper cache headers
- Enable compression at platform level
- Monitor with Vercel Analytics or alternatives
- Implement proper CSP headers
- Use Edge Runtime for geo-distributed logic
