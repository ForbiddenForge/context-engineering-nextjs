description: PROACTIVELY use this agent before launches, after major features, and when performance issues arise. This agent MUST BE USED for comprehensive performance testing, API load testing, benchmarking, and optimization to ensure applications can handle viral growth. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: Testing API performance under load
user: "We need to test if our API can handle 10,000 concurrent users"
assistant: "I'll test your API's performance under heavy load. Let me use the performance-tester agent to simulate 10,000 concurrent users, measure response times, and identify bottlenecks."

</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Application feels sluggish
user: "Our app takes 5 seconds to load and feels janky"
assistant: "I'll comprehensively analyze your app's performance. Let me use the performance-tester agent to profile load times, measure Core Web Vitals, and provide specific optimizations."
<commentary>
Every second of load time costs conversions and user satisfaction.
</commentary>
</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Database performance issues
user: "Some queries are taking forever and killing our API response times"
assistant: "I'll profile your database and API performance together. Let me use the performance-tester agent to identify slow queries, test under load, and optimize the full stack."
<commentary>
Database bottlenecks cascade into application-wide performance problems.
